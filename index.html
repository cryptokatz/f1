Bosses from Red Bull and Honda are set to meet at Silverstone over the weekend to address the team’s poor start to the season.
Red Bull went into the 2020 campaign looking to take the fight to Mercedes in the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championship, saying their preparations for this campaign were the best since their final double title-winning season in 2013.
So far though it hasn’t turned out too well for the Austrian outfit with Mercedes storming their way to pole and victory in the first three rounds, whilst a P2 for Max Verstappen in Hungary is the best Red Bull have to show for their efforts so far.
The team do currently occupy P2 in the Constructors’ Championship, but already they are 66 points behind Mercedes.
Red Bull principal Christian Horner has said the RB16 is “misbehaving aerodynamically“, whilst Honda are also concerned that their engine isn’t helping the situation.
So, they are going to sit down and talk at Red Bull’s Milton Keynes HQ before Friday practice at Silverstone to sort out a plan moving forward.
“It’s important now that both Red Bull and us have some suspicions and discuss the solution together,” Honda F1’s Managing Director Masashi Yamamoto told autosport-web.jp.

“Without that, we would end the season without being able to catch up with Mercedes. In order to make the car evolve even a day, we decided to discuss it carefully before the British GP.”
Speaking to the Honda website, Honda F1 technical director Toyoharu Tanabe added: “In the first triple header, we had two podium finishes with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing. However, we saw a clear gap to our rival therefore we are now working together with Red Bull to close it.
“In HRD-Sakura, we have worked on coming up with solutions for the issues we encountered during those first three races, while also analysing and optimising our PU management strategy.
“Silverstone is usually one of the highlights of the F1 year, with a huge crowd of enthusiastic and knowledgeful fans, in the country that can be considered the home of motorsport, but unfortunately that great atmosphere they create will be missing this year.
“This is the circuit where our whole car-PU package is given a severe test. We and our two teams learned a lot from the first three races and we will be putting that to good use this weekend, for the first of two races on consecutive weekends at Silverstone.
“Last year we had a tough race when an incident kept us off the podium. We think it won’t be easy this year either.”

Martin Brundle has explained the commotion he inadvertently caused when mentioning on air that Sebastian Vettel had asked him for an interview.
Speculation about a reveal-all interview about his Ferrari split and Formula 1 retirement at the end of the season soon followed after Brundle teased the sit-down discussion during Sky Sports F1’s live coverage of the Styrian Grand Prix.
The interview was broadcast ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix but those looking for some juicy gossip were ultimately left disappointed.
“I met Seb on the corner of the TV compound [in Austria],” Brundle told Motorsport.com.
“He was heading off somewhere. We were in our masks, socially distanced, and he said ‘Let’s do an interview. Let’s do an interview’. I said ‘Okay. Let’s do that. What do you want to talk about?’

“He said: ‘You make it up. I said: ‘Okay, I’ll make it up. Let’s do an interview.’ And that was it.
“Then I stupidly mentioned that, because Crofty [David Croft] was supposed to throw to Ted [Kravitz] in the grandstand and he missed, as obviously we’ve got completely different systems to what we would normally have at a grand prix, and somehow Crofty thought he had to throw it to me.
“I was walking back out, and I just heard something about Vettel. And I said: “Oh, yeah, sorry, I didn’t know you’d come to me Crofty. Vettel? Yeah. Actually he’s asked me for an interview.”

He continued: “Of course that turned into ‘Sebastian Vettel is going to retire, he’s asked Brundle for an interview.’
“It was nothing more cunning than that. And it was my own stupidity because I suddenly was live on air and wasn’t expecting to be.
“If that fills you in on how all that came about, there was nothing – as so often happens in these stories. There’s nothing more exciting than that.”
Vettel has been strongly linked with a move to Racing Point, who look poised to trigger a release clause in Sergio Perez’s contract to pave the way for the four-time World Champion to join the team that will be known as Aston Martin from 2021.

Fernando Alonso’s physio, Edoardo Bendinelli, has dashed any doubt about the Spaniard’s fitness levels as he prepares to return to Formula 1.
The two-time World Champion, who recently turned 39, is back on the grid with Renault for a third time in his career and will turn 40 during his first campaign back.
His age has left many pondering whether Alonso is still capable of performing at the highest level but his physio reckons he is more like 29 rather than 39.
“In terms of weight and physical shape, he is back at the level of 2009 to 2011,” Bendinelli told Marca newspaper.
“We made a training schedule so that he would be as he was at his peak, as he was in 2010 when he went to Ferrari.
“We compared all the parameters of the past with those of today and have started with the goal of getting back to the level of ten years ago. He wants to have the body and the head to do what he wants with a car.”

Upon the announcement of Alonso’s return and subsequent interviews, some had made comments about Alonso’s weight loss.
He said it was down to an illness but it was not coronavirus after his test came back negative.
“I got tested for corona but did not have the virus,” Alonso said. “I lost some strength and appetite but in the meantime I am back at the [fitness] figures from years ago.
“I used to play football in the morning, then tennis, then cycling and in the evening I went karting.
“That is no longer possible which is why I train differently now. I refine the details and work on my weaknesses. I am better than ever.
“If you take two steps back and look at everything calmly, you appreciate things in a different way. I’m a much better driver now than when I left Formula 1.
“And my age? Nonsense. Speed is determined by the watch, not your age.”

Ex-Formula 1 driver Giedo van der Garde has called on Red Bull to replace Alex Albon with Sergio Perez for the 2021 season.
Sebastian Vettel administered the first dose of silly season frenzy when it emerged that his contract with Ferrari was not going to be renewed for the 2021 campaign.
That saw McLaren’s Carlos Sainz take his seat and Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo being the one to replace the departing Spaniard.
Now Vettel is set to trigger the next wave of moves as he looks to find a seat on the 2021 grid. That seat appears to be at the soon-to-be-named Aston Martin team.
It is believed the space for Vettel’s arrival would be created by triggering a release clause in Perez’s contract, which in turn would make him a free agent on the market.
Van Der Garde believes the Mexican driver would be a great choice to replace the struggling Alex Albon and help give Max Verstappen the competition that he craves.

“If Red Bull is smart, they’ll put Perez in the second car next to Max Verstappen,” Van der Garde told Dutch outlet Racingnews365.
“He’s better than Alexander Albon. We expected him to do better this year than last year, but he’s just too slow.
“You can see that in qualifying, in which he invariably admits himself he is half a second behind compared to Verstappen.
However, I think Perez is someone who has the speed to chase Verstappen. Max could use someone like that, you saw that in the years when Daniel Ricciardo was his team-mate.”
Asked if swapping Albon for Perez would mean the end of the former’s Formula 1 career, he said: “That may not even be necessary.
“Last year he performed quite well at AlphaTauri, perhaps he can return to that team. But it’s up to Red Bull to find out.”
With Perez seemingly the outgoing driver at Racing Point, Van Der Garde thinks Sebastian Vettel is a signing that makes a lot of sense.
“Racing Point would be a great team for him [Vettel]”, Van der Garde added.
“Vettel is someone who needs confidence to perform really well and Racing Point, which of course will be Aston Martin next year, can give him that by offering him a seat.
“For a brand like Aston Martin, the name Vettel can also be a great PR.”

Williams‘ head of vehicle performance, Dave Robson, thinks more teams would have gone down the copycat route had there not been a chassis freeze next year.
While copying, or being inspired by others has been part and parcel of Formula 1 since its inception, the Racing Point RP20 has been at the centre of a lengthy discussion as to how far the boundaries can be pushed before the car can be deemed illegal.
A decision from the FIA is expected prior to the British Grand Prix after Renault protested the legality of the car, starting with the front and rear brake ducts that the Enstone team believe have been recreated by drawings given to Racing Point by Mercedes.
As we all await the verdict, Robson believes if all is above board and legal then, given the amount of performance gains that Racing Point has been able to find by ditching their own philosophy, other teams would have been seriously considering going down the same route whether they liked it or not.
“I think potentially you would have to,” Robson told Motorsport.com when asked about whether Williams, amongst others, would start copying the Mercedes.
“I think it is clear that for quite a few years Mercedes has been the standout car. Even though the Red Bull and Ferrari at times have excelled at certain circuits, the Mercedes is a go-anywhere package.
“However they do it, it is phenomenal and their pace [in Hungary was] just borderline outrageous compared to the rest of the field.
“When you look at the harsh reality of that, and you look at the way Racing Point have been able to do it, then you would have to give it a serious go I think.
“If there is that much lap time to be found and that is the way to find it, I think you would have to follow that route.”

Robson can understand why Racing Point decided to change their approach now that they are financially stable Formula 1 team.
“Perhaps Racing Point felt that with big changes coming up in what would have been 2021, but now 2022, they could afford to take that risk and financially they were stable, so if it backfired this year then maybe it wouldn’t have mattered,” he added.
“I think it is an incredibly difficult decision to make to completely change your concept. You’ve got to be so confident that you can copy it, understand it and make it work.
“It is the concept you need. You can’t just photograph it and copy it like that and expect it to work. It is too complicated for that.
“But you would have to look seriously at it given the success they have had with that approach. You would have to look very, very seriously at it.”

Valtteri Bottas is confident he has the pace to prevent Lewis Hamilton from winning a record-equalling seventh World Championship title.
Bottas and Hamilton appear to be in their own exclusive battle for the World Championship title as Mercedes‘ dominance has showed no signs of weakening since the revised 2020 calendar began.
The Finn won the season opening race for the second year in a row following victory at the Austrian Grand Prix and is confident he can reverse the outcome from 2019 when Hamilton emerged the clear victor in the title challenge.
“I think my performance has been good,” Bottas said, as quoted by GPFans.
“There have been some unlucky events that have cost me a little bit, but performance-wise, I’m pleased. It’s a very encouraging start.
“I think I do have the pace this year to win the title, but obviously it’s an individual battle every single weekend, and everything needs to go right.
“It didn’t go right in Austria in the wet qualifying; it didn’t go right in Hungary because of the race start, but from each weekend, I’ve learned again massively.
“Going to Silverstone, I was on pole last year, so I’m confident going there. It’s a good track. I know Lewis is strong, no doubt. He is strong everywhere, but I also believe in my ability to be able to beat him, and that’s the big goal for me.”

As for whether he agrees that the title battle is already a two-horse race between himself and Hamilton, he replied: “At this point, based on two different tracks, we have been the best, and sometimes with a big margin. That’s a fact.
“But you just never know how a season can go, and if we start thinking that way, that’s going to be a mistake from our side, so we’re going to continue to keep pushing.
“If you look at the future, I think if you ask anyone in the world, what would you predict [as to] how it’s going to be, yes, this one you would say is going to be between me and Lewis.
“But you just never know. It is Formula 1 and anything can change. For me, the main thing is to improve on my performance and beating my team-mate and everyone else on track.”

Lando Norris has said he is feeling “better” as he prepares for two home races at Silverstone over the next couple of weeks.
Away from the title picture dominated by Mercedes, Norris has been one of the stand-out drivers thus far after clinching his first-ever podium finish on the very last lap in Austria.
One week later at the Styrian Grand Prix, ‘Last Lap Lando’ struck again as he moved from P8 to P5 at the Red Bull Ring. Norris finished outside the points in Hungary, but at least he was in better physical shape compared to the first two races.

“I’m doing better,” Norris told reporters, as quoted by the official Formula 1 website. 
“Hungary was much better already than the Red Bull Ring race – round two. There I was in a pretty bad way. I couldn’t drive without being on the painkillers at all so that was a bit of a lifesaver from my end in just letting me get out on track and drive.
“By the time we went to Hungary it was already better and obviously I went back and saw the specialist and the doctors and everyone and we kind of figured out a bit more what the problem was.
“It wasn’t something that we could just fix, it’s something that we think is going to take time.
“Even those few days of time between the two race weekends I felt better and I did FP3 with no painkillers and I was fine, and I performed well and so on.
“My only worry was going into the race or qualifying when you have the highest brake pressure, and then the race when it’s just the longevity of it that something could arise.
“It wasn’t that I couldn’t drive, it was just something I was a bit more hesitant about thinking what happens if it does come up in the race? Then I might struggle.
“So I was fine from my side and from what I knew, but I think it’s just something that will take a bit of time to get better from my side, because it’s just more bruising basically.
“It was just pure bruising from driving a Formula 1 car having not driven one for so long. So I should be fine come Silverstone.”
Heading into the double header at Silverstone, Norris occupies P4 in the World Championship with 26 points.

The W11 may look unbeatable but Mercedes do have a couple of concerns about their car heading into the next triple header of races.
The Silver Arrows’ latest title challenger has won all three races so far during the revised 2020 season with Valtteri Bottas winning the opener in Austria before Lewis Hamilton bagged back-to-back race victories.
The Mercedes W11 is in a league of its own but it is not without its own imperfections which is keeping the garage on their toes.
Small plumes of smoke have not only been spotted on the W11 but also on their customer team cars (Racing Point and Williams) too.
Wolff did not have the answer as to why this was happening but was hoping the team would have more of an idea at Silverstone.
“You can see it when the oil tank is filled up at the beginning, we seem to have an issue that the oil gets out of the chassis,” Wolff told the press at the Hungarian Grand Prix.
“We don’t know where that comes from, but it seems when we fill it up to the top we are not in much control of how much escapes at the beginning.
“We see it on all the Mercedes engines and it’s something that we need to understand and get on top of.
“It’s not a reliability issue, which I’m glad that it isn’t, and probably in Silverstone I can respond to what it is, because at the moment I don’t know.”

Mercedes also has concerns about how their W11 in hot weather.
“I’d note that we’ve had two quite cool tracks,” tech director James Allison told Autosport.com.
“So far it was warmish in the first race of the year, but that was also the race where we were least convincing.
“So we would like to find out just how swift we can be when the track is roasting hot, and whether or not we can still show the sort of tyre management and pace under those conditions that we’ve been lucky enough to show in the opening races of the year.”
The Silver Arrows may be able to get some answers to that particular issue in Friday practice where a sweltering day awaits at Silverstone.
However, the conditions will be cooler again for both qualifying and the all-important race on Sunday.

Martin Brundle thinks Max Verstappen will be pondering how he can get himself into a Mercedes seat if he continues to not win titles with Red Bull.
The youngest-ever driver to make a start in Formula 1 and the youngest-ever race winner, Verstappen has made no secret of the fact that he wanted to complete the trifecta by becoming the youngest-ever Formula 1 World Champion.
But time is running out on achieving that particular feat and, regardless of the record, it appears Red Bull and Verstappen still have quite a lot of catching up to do if they are to be the ones to knock Mercedes off their perch any time soon.
However, Brundle feels there will become a point where Verstappen will try and move to Mercedes in the future to realise his title dreams if Red Bull are ultimately unable to deliver the goods for him.
“I think we’re going to hear more frustrated radio messages,” Brundle told Motorsport.com.
“But his team have been really great at the pit stops and did a great job getting him to the start in Hungary. And I think he really appreciates that, to some extent, as a sort of ‘one for all, all for one’.
“But Max will also look around and think ‘how am I going to win a World Championship?’ If Mercedes continues to participate, he’ll also be thinking: ‘how do I get into that Mercedes at some point?'”

Even though the 202o season is just three races old, Brundle believes the frustration will already be growing with Verstappen 30 points behind World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton heading into the double header at Silverstone.
“I think he is very frustrated. I mean, already after a couple of laps this season he dropped out, and what did we say? DNFs are not an option, and he has one,” Brundle added.
“Normally Red Bull appears with a package that seems to have all the ingredients, and about halfway through the season they let it coincide in the most impressive way.
“Once again the car seems to have a lot of potential, but they really need to pull it out. We will see it at Silverstone. I think the chassis is strong enough and Honda looks strong too, but let’s wait and see.
“Let’s wait and see what the long turns at Silverstone bring them and what things they have found. They’ll master the car, but the question is when?”
Verstappen extended his Red Bull contract back in January 2020 until the end of the 2023 season.

George Russell admits that whilst he has total faith in himself, joining Mercedes in 2021 and trying to compete with Lewis Hamilton would have been a “tall order”.
Russell has been part of the Mercedes junior programme since 2016 and has risen sharply through the junior series with their backing, winning the GP3 and F2 titles back-to-back in 2017 and 2018, before graduating to Formula 1 with Williams in 2019.
The Briton showed signs of being a star for the future in 2019 despite being unable to score any points in the disappointing FW42, but with Williams this year taking a step forward Russell has already been knocking on the door of Q3 twice, having failed to make it out of Q1 throughout 2019.
Understandably Russell was in contention for a Mercedes drive for 2021, though the team chose to stick with six-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton and his current team-mate Valtteri Bottas.
Though Russell believes that may not be such a bad thing, as he said going up against Hamilton in the team he has effectively molded around himself would be a “tall order”.

Speaking on the Beyond The Grid podcast, he said: “Being put in the car next to one of the best drivers ever, who’s been in the same car, the same team for seven years, the same engineers – it would have been a tall order.
I'”ve got confidence and faith in myself [but] who knows how that would have gone.
“I’ve got full confidence in Mercedes that they are fully supporting me, they’ve made that clear from day one.
“Obviously a lot of people can think what they want following recent decisions but… nothing has changed in my relationship with Toto [Wolff, Mercedes Team Principal], with the guys at Mercedes.
“Me and Toto had a long socially distant breakfast together last week, a couple of hours talking about everything, and like I say, I’ve got full faith in everybody there that I’m in their minds, and as long as I perform, they will hopefully give me an opportunity.”

And the branding for PMI and BAT is pervasive, enjoying the most impactful, prominent placements on the cars and driver suits to maximize media exposure.“For 2020, BAT has considerably expanded its sponsorship of McLaren. Almost double the amount of branding was seen on the cars at the season-opener in Austria, advertising an oral tobacco product, Velo. This expanded branding is worth an estimated $40 million, boosting total annual spending by tobacco companies on F1 to $115 million in 2020.“The association with a technology-driven sport is valuable to PMI and BAT as they roll out their respective “corporate transformation” narratives. It’s more advantageous for their corporate brands to be associated in consumers’ minds with technology and innovation instead of the less attractive reality of cigarette smoke and tobacco-related disease and death.”Additionally, the report demands that F1’s governing body, the FIA, hold the teams accountable.“In its #PurposeDriven initiative, the FIA claims that it wants to promote a net positive contribution to society. That is impossible while it allows tobacco companies that contribute to health, environmental and economic harm to remain involved in F1.“PMI and BAT have not changed: They produce and sell hundreds of billions of cigarettes annually, while more than 8 million people die from tobacco use every year.“Their new products are not safe, either: There is no safe way to consume tobacco. In short, their business continues to be producing and selling addictive and harmful products, often targeting children and young people.”The post Report alleges F1 teams ‘driving addiction’ with renewed tobacco sponsorships appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/30/report-alleges-f1-teams-driving-addiction-with-renewed-tobacco-sponsorships/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Second triple-header will be more of a challenge than the first – Seidl  - <span class="source">RaceFans</span><br /><span class="time">06:01 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>In the round-up: Second triple-header will be more of a challenge than the first - Seidl • Reliability more important in shortened season - Wolff • Sutil unhurt in McLaren road car crash</p><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/30/racefans-round-up-30-07-3/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Official British Touring Car Championship game to arrive in 2022  - <span class="source">RaceFans</span><br /><span class="time">11:15 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>The British Touring Car Championship, which inspired the popular TOCA series, will have an officially-licensed racing game from 2022.</p><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/29/official-british-touring-car-championship-game-to-arrive-in-2022/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Russell: DTM was the next best thing to F1 - <span class="source">GRAND PRIX 247</span><br /><span class="time">10:39 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Russell at a DTM test at Jerez with BMW in 2016.In Formula 1’s Beyond the Grid Podcast, George Russell has revealed he was on the verge of joining BMW in DTM for 2017.Russell had been an unofficial reserve driver for BMW in the DTM during the 2016 season. Having impressed during a rookie test, the Brit had an offer on the table to sign as a full-time driver in 2017.“By this point, I’d sort of accepted I didn’t have any backing to help me get to Formula 1,” Russell told Tom Clarkson.“At the time, none of the Formula 1 teams were overly interested and I was pretty settled to say, this is DTM, it was a huge salary, it’s probably the next best thing to Formula 1 and I was committed to going down that route.”In 2016, Russell was competing with HitechGP in the European Formula 3 series. In 30 starts, he claimed ten podiums along with two wins and three pole positions. Enough to secure third in the championship.That was enough to impress Gwen Lagrue – Mercedes’ Driver Development Advisor who started working with the team in January 2016.“One day I was just laying in the bath and I got a phone call from a French guy called Gwen Lagrue… He said to me, ‘Hi George… I’ve just started working with Mercedes and you’re the first guy I want to sign…”Russell signed a contract with Mercedes that started in 2016, but became an official Mercedes junior driver at the start of 2017. With the team, he would go on to win both GP3 and Formula 2 titles before earning a seat with Williams in F1.With both Mercedes drivers out of a contract at the end of the year, speculation pointed towards Russell joining the Silver Arrows next season. The 22-year-old put an end to the rumours when he announced he would stay with Williams for 2021, honouring his multi-year contract.Being put in the car next to one of the best drivers ever, who’s been in the same car, the same team for seven years, the same engineers – it would have been a tall order,” says Russell. “I’ve got confidence and faith in myself [but] who knows how that would have gone.“I’ve got full confidence in Mercedes that they are fully supporting me,” he adds. “They’ve made that clear from day one.“Obviously a lot of people can think what they want following recent decisions but… nothing has changed in my relationship with Toto [Wolff, Mercedes Team Principal], with the guys at Mercedes – me and Toto had a long socially distant breakfast together last week, a couple of hours talking about everything, and like I say, I’ve got full faith in everybody there that I’m in their minds, and as long as I perform, they will hopefully give me an opportunity.”   The post Russell: DTM was the next best thing to F1 appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/russell-dtm-was-the-next-best-thing-to-f1/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Honda and Red Bull to hold emergency meeting - <span class="source">GRAND PRIX 247</span><br /><span class="time">09:52 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Honda bosses are set to meet with their Red Bull counterparts prior to the British Grand Prix in an effort to improve on the team’s slow start to the 2020 Formula 1 season.Having voiced the expectation that they would at least challenge for the driver’s championship with Max Verstappen in 2020, Red Bull’s season so far has been a significant disappointment, as they remain well behind leaders Mercedes in terms of pure pace.Last week Red Bull team principal Christian Horner admitted that the RB16 was underperforming, and while he attributed this to it ‘misbehaving aerodynamically’, Honda engineers are concerned that the balance and/or performance of their engine could also be having an adverse effect.As a result, the two sides have set up a meeting at Red Bull’s Milton Keynes base prior to Friday practice at Silverstone.“It’s important now that both Red Bull and us have some suspicions and discuss the solution together,” Honda F1’s Managing Director Masashi Yamamoto explained to autosport-web.jp.“Without that, we would end the season without being able to catch up with Mercedes. In order to make the car evolve even a day, we decided to discuss it carefully before the British GP.”A measure that takes on extra significance given the current social-distancing protocols due to the coronavirus, Yamamoto will be joined by Honda’s Sakura factory boss Yasuaki Asaki and technical director Toyoharu Tanabe for the in-person meeting.The post Honda and Red Bull to hold emergency meeting appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/honda-and-red-bull-to-hold-emergency-meeting/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Aston Martin would be "foreign territory" for Vettel - <span class="source">Motorsport.com</span><br /><span class="time">09:36 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>With Vettel in talks with Aston Martin about a seat at the team next year, the current Racing Point outfit's strong form has increased the chances of the German electing to commit his F1 future there.But, the move away from a team like Ferrari that targets the world championship to an outfit like Aston Martin that is chasing podiums would need a new mindset.Ricciardo has first hand ...Keep reading</p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/vettel-open-mind-aston-martin-ricciardo/4845598/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RSS-F1&utm_term=News&utm_content=www" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">McLaren wants F1 regulations tightened to prevent further car copying - <span class="source">Autosport</span><br /><span class="time">09:24 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>McLaren Formula 1 chief Andreas Seidl is eager for the regulations to be tightened to limit the extent to which teams can copy other cars</p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/150904/mclaren-rules-need-tightened-to-stop-car-copying" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Italian Grand Prix to run without fans - <span class="source">GRAND PRIX 247</span><br /><span class="time">09:22 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>The Italian Grand Prix will take place without fans, it was confirmed on Wednesday.Despite previously indicating it was unlikely spectators could attend when Formula 1 comes to Monza on September 6, race organisers had still been selling tickets in the hope restrictions would ease alongside the COVID-19 pandemic.However, organisers have now stated unequivocally that the race, which is set to be the eighth of the 2020 season, will indeed proceed without fans.“The 2020 Formula 1 Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza from 4-6 September will take place behind closed doors, i.e. without spectators,” Monza officials said in a statement.“Tickets already purchased will be refunded for the full value of the face price shown on them.”Possessing possibly the most famously passionate fans on the F1 calendar, the Italian Grand Prix is traditionally a chance for the legions of Ferrari supporters, known as tifosi, to celebrate their national team.Alas, the restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic mean this year’s event will be markedly different, with F1’s use of fan videos little substitute for the thousands of flag-waving fans and that usually provide such a memorable atmosphere.The post Italian Grand Prix to run without fans appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/italian-grand-prix-to-run-without-fans/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Who are the best British F1 drivers statistically?

Team mate Valtteri Bottas won the opener at the Red Bull Ring.The pair have also been alone on pole so far and Silverstone’s long and fast lap will suit their car, but team boss Toto Wolff is taking nothing for granted.“We’ve had a good start to the season: we resolved the issues that troubled us on the first weekend, won three out of three races and scored a good amount of points,” said the Austrian.“But the first three races have also highlighted another crucial factor: the importance of reliability in this shortened season.“We’re one of only two teams that have finished all races with both cars this year and we know how quickly a DNF (no-finish) can make a lead in the points disappear.”Hamilton is five points clear of Bottas but 30 ahead of third-placed Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, who has been on the podium in the last two races.“We know the areas we need to work on and with Silverstone being a home race close to the factory, that’s good news,” said the Dutch youngster.“I think we can hopefully get a good result there, historically it’s been a pretty good track for the team, and it’s one I really enjoy driving.”Racing Point, with a factory across the road, could be Mercedes’ closest rivals with their car a close copy of the one Hamilton drove to the title last season.They can expect to be protested again by Renault afterwards, with a stewards’ decision on the legality of the car not expected until August.Ferrari, 17 times winners in Britain, have slumped to fifth overall and the first high-speed circuit of the season may bring more pain.“We know that from a pure competitiveness point of view it will be difficult, but we need to focus on acquiring the best information possible so that we can develop our car in the right direction,” said sporting director Laurent Mekies.The post British GP Preview: Hamilton aims for a hat-trick appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/british-gp-preview-hamilton-aims-for-a-hat-trick/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Seidl wants F1 regulations tightened to prevent more copying -

<span class="source">GRAND PRIX 247</span><br /><span class="time">05:55 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>AlphaTauri could follow in the footsteps of Racing Point by producing a copy of Red Bull’s car, says team advisor Helmut Marko.Currently under protest by Renault, the Racing Point RP20 is in many ways a copy of technical-partners Mercedes’ 2019 car, the W10, and is alleged to have illegally used the same brake duct design on its 2020 challenger.With a verdict expected before the British Grand Prix this weekend, Marko says a dismissal could lead him to pursue a similar avenue with Red Bull sister team AlphaTauri, even if he understands why some in the paddock remain opposed to such a practice.“I have no problem, if that is allowed,” he told Kronen Zeitung. “Then we can do the same with Alpha Tauri and save money on top of it. But this secret trickery bothers me. If it is allowed, then it should be allowed and you can stand by it one hundred percent.“We’d have, like, four Red Bulls. But for teams like Renault or McLaren that don’t have a B team, it’s a problem.”Not the only way in which the case will affect his team, Racing Point have been serious challengers for Red Bull’s title as best-of-the-rest in 2020, with Marko they could have the upper hand at Silverstone.“[It’s a] power track,” he said. “So the Pink Mercedes will be dangerous as hell!”The post Marko: If Pink Mercedes is approved, we can do the same with AlphaTauri appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/marko-if-pink-mercedes-is-approved-we-can-do-the-same-with-alphatauri/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Italian GP will take place behind closed doors - <span class="source">Motorsport.com</span><br /><span class="time">05:47 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>After being forced to call off the opening 10 races of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, F1 managed to get the 2020 campaign underway earlier this month in Austria.All races so far this season have been 'closed events, taking place with no spectators and with limited personnel at the circuits.F1 bosses have been optimistic about getting fans to races by autumn.

Valtteri is there on a bad Lewis day. And on a good day, Lewis can’t be beat.“The dynamics and the mood between the two is right, which is very important. If you have two large egos in the team, it will be difficult with the constructor’s championship. They both respect the team and the influence they have on the mood in the team. Therefore, the two are the best solution for us.”Of course, the speculation around Bottas’ future is nothing new, although the criticism has increased in recent weeks after his strong win in the opening race of 2020 in Austria was followed by two comfortable wins for Hamilton.Complicating matters is that Wolff has two highly-regarded drivers – George Russell and Esteban Ocon – waiting in the wings, but the Austrian doesn’t see either making a switch in the near future.“With George Russell it is clear that he has another year with Williams. Esteban will be a Renault driver until next year. So it’s a medium-term question of how we line up with the two.”As to whether he can afford to wait that long with Russell, who has made it clear he wants a more competitive drive, Wolff did not seem concerned.“He is not lost. Even if we don’t open a door, he’s still a Mercedes driver. I’m not worried that we wouldn’t find a place for him. But that’s still a long way off.”The post Wolff: Lewis and Valtteri are the best solution for us appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/wolff-lewis-and-valtteri-are-the-best-solution-for-us/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Norris: Mugello addition to F1 calendar "awesome" but may lack overtaking - <span class="source">Autosport</span><br /><span class="time">03:10 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>McLaren's Lando Norris says that the Mugello circuit is an "awesome" addition to the 2020 F1 calendar, but says the high-speed Italian circuit is unlikely to see much overtaking</p><a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/150893/norris-mugello-awesome-but-may-lack-overtaking" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">COTA suffering “blow after blow” with US GP cancellation  - <span class="source">RaceFans</span><br /><span class="time">03:03 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>The chairman of the Circuit of the Americas says the cancellation of its Formula 1 round, which promised strong ticket sales this year, is the latest in a series of blows for the venue.</p><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/29/cota-suffering-blow-after-blow-with-us-gp-cancellation/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">2020 British Grand Prix TV Times  - <span class="source">RaceFans</span><br /><span class="time">02:56 AM</span></button><div class="content"><p>This weekend's British Grand Prix is the only live F1 race on free-to-air television in the UK this year.

While he is only 11 points behind Max Verstappen, concerns have been raised about the Thai’s ability to keep-up with his teammate’s pace.Currently, Albon’s average qualifying position is four places lower than Verstappen’s, while in the last race in Hungary, he finished nearly 70 seconds behind the Dutchman.Rennie, who has also engineered for Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, will replace Mike Lugg, who the team states “remains under contract” and will move to the factory.The post Rennie to return trackside as Albon’s engineer appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/29/rennie-to-return-trackside-as-albons-engineer/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Further appeals over Racing Point design would be “a waste of time” – Szafnauer  - <span class="source">RaceFans</span><br /><span class="time">06:01 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>In the round-up: Further appeals over Racing Point design would be "a waste of time" - Szafnauer • Williams bringing upgrade to Silverstone • New race engineer for Albon</p><a href="https://www.racefans.net/2020/07/29/racefans-round-up-29-07-3/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Reports on Vettel just days left to sign for Racing Point - <span class="source">Reports on Vettel just days left to sign for Racing Point | thejudge13</span><br /><span class="time">04:20 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Reluctant to sign his new contract, Sebastian Vettel has been given an ultimatum by Racing Point Formula 1 team according to the German press.
