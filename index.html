Nico Hulkenberg was chosen over Esteban Gutierrez as the stand-in for Sergio Perez at the British Grand Prix because Racing Point wanted “someone who could score points for us”.
Those were the words of team boss Otmar Szafnauer as he reflected upon a dramatic Thursday at Silverstone during which Perez initially had an ‘inconclusive’ test for COVID-19 and then a positive one, ruling him out of this weekend’s race.
The scramble then began to find a replacement for the Mexican, with Gutierrez and Stoffel Vandoorne being the initial names in the frame. Vandoorne, however, was discarded from the reckoning due to Formula E commitments.
But then Hulkenberg, who drove for Force India in 2011-12 and 2014-16 before their Racing Point rebrand, entered the equation and on Friday morning came confirmation, with the German taking part in FP1 and finishing a highly respectable P9 – 1.17sec off the pace.
Quoted by RaceFans.net, Szafnauer explained in Friday’s FIA press conference: “I started thinking about this when Checo’s first test was inconclusive, hoping the next test was negative but you’ve got to hope for the best and plan for the worst.
“So we started that planning and did it in parallel with Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez at the same time.
“Our engineering team, after we discussed, thought Nico would be more appropriate for our team because he knows us really well, he knows all the engineers, he knows our systems, our processes, he’s driven our simulator, it would be easy for him to get in the simulator again.
“And also he has relevant experience from having driven in Formula 1 last year (for Renault). We just needed someone that could score points for us, so we thought Nico would be the best guy for us.”

After receiving a call from Szafnauer on Thursday, Hulkenberg hotfooted it from Germany where he had been due to make an appearance at the Nurburgring.
“He had just landed in Germany,” said Szafnauer. “I think he was due to do some kind of sports car test or something, I don’t know what category of racing.
“He said ‘I just landed here, I’m going to do a test’. And I said ‘well, maybe you should jump in a Formula 1 car’. So he said ‘yeah, absolutely’.
“I think he spent an hour on the ground in Cologne to grab his boots and a helmet. I think the helmet he grabbed isn’t to spec anyway. Then he flew to Birmingham, so he landed here about 7.00, 7.30 last night.”
Hulkenberg then required a negative COVID-19 test before he could enter the F1 paddock – which was only confirmed by F1 test supplier Eurofins 15 minutes before FP1 began.
Szafnauer said Hulkenberg began the session five minutes late as a result, adding: “We got the ‘go’ from Eurofins at 10.45 saying his test came back negative. So then we had to quickly get him in the car.
“But he quickly came up to speed and his feedback was as it always is. So there’s more improvement in the car, there’s things he doesn’t like, things he does like. So we will make those improvements between now and FP2 and see how we go, but I think he was ninth and pretty comfortable.”

First we have the traditional British Grand Prix, then the renamed 70th Anniversary Grand Prix will follow a week later.
Will Lewis Hamilton be able to record yet more race success at the track, even without the thousands of fans in attendance to cheer him on?
Can Red Bull provide the almighty Mercedes with a bigger scare than they have been able to manage so far?

Bosses from Red Bull and Honda are set to meet at Silverstone over the weekend to address the team’s poor start to the season.
Red Bull went into the 2020 campaign looking to take the fight to Mercedes in the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championship, saying their preparations for this campaign were the best since their final double title-winning season in 2013.
So far though it hasn’t turned out too well for the Austrian outfit with Mercedes storming their way to pole and victory in the first three rounds, whilst a P2 for Max Verstappen in Hungary is the best Red Bull have to show for their efforts so far.
The team do currently occupy P2 in the Constructors’ Championship, but already they are 66 points behind Mercedes.
Red Bull principal Christian Horner has said the RB16 is “misbehaving aerodynamically“, whilst Honda are also concerned that their engine isn’t helping the situation.
So, they are going to sit down and talk at Red Bull’s Milton Keynes HQ before Friday practice at Silverstone to sort out a plan moving forward.
“It’s important now that both Red Bull and us have some suspicions and discuss the solution together,” Honda F1’s Managing Director Masashi Yamamoto told autosport-web.jp.

“Without that, we would end the season without being able to catch up with Mercedes. In order to make the car evolve even a day, we decided to discuss it carefully before the British GP.”
Speaking to the Honda website, Honda F1 technical director Toyoharu Tanabe added: “In the first triple header, we had two podium finishes with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing. However, we saw a clear gap to our rival therefore we are now working together with Red Bull to close it.
“In HRD-Sakura, we have worked on coming up with solutions for the issues we encountered during those first three races, while also analysing and optimising our PU management strategy.
“Silverstone is usually one of the highlights of the F1 year, with a huge crowd of enthusiastic and knowledgeful fans, in the country that can be considered the home of motorsport, but unfortunately that great atmosphere they create will be missing this year.
“This is the circuit where our whole car-PU package is given a severe test. We and our two teams learned a lot from the first three races and we will be putting that to good use this weekend, for the first of two races on consecutive weekends at Silverstone.
“Last year we had a tough race when an incident kept us off the podium. We think it won’t be easy this year either.”

Red Bull’s motorsport advisor, Dr Helmut Marko, is confident the change in race engineer will help Alex Albon reach his potential at the team.
Even though Albon has had genuine chances at a first Formula 1 podium slip away from his grasp of late, he has been under pressure because of an inability to keep up with the pace set by Max Verstappen on the other side of the garage.
There have been calls for Red Bull to ditch Albon for a more established driver such as Sebastian Vettel or Sergio Perez for 2021 but the team are sticking by the British-Thai driver and are trying to help him.
That help has come with experienced race engineer Simon Rennie being drafted back into the garage and Marko is hopeful we will all see a notable improvement from Albon.
“His former engineer didn’t do a bad job, but he was still new to the job. It’s also down to us that Albon has not been able to tap into his full potential,” Marko told f1-insider.com.
“His new race engineer has a lot of experience and will be able to help him. I am sure that there will be an increase in performance from the very first race at Silverstone.”
Albon also absolved his now former race engineer, Mike Lugg, from any blame in his troubles as he returns to a factory role.
“I didn’t have any problems with Mike,” Albon said.
“It’s just that the car is very difficult to drive and the team decided that in such a situation, someone with more experience is needed.”

Rennie was the former race engineer for Daniel Ricciardo during his Red Bull days and the Aussie is a big fan.
“He obviously has a lot of experience and he’s very good,” Ricciardo said of Rennie.
“A driver/race engineer relationship, first and foremost, there needs to be a relationship – you need to get on with each other you need to understand each other.
Simon understood me and understood that I was, at times, different. But we had, I think, that connection and that chemistry and that helped me put my faith and trust in him.
“As far as Alex goes, now with Simon, I’m sure that it’s going to go good. We’ll see. Every driver’s different but I certainly had a very good few years with Simon.”

Lewis Hamilton’s car has been fitted with a new MGU-K for the British Grand Prix, but it’s merely a precaution according to Mercedes.
Each of the teams with Mercedes power units were scheduled to receive a new spec of the part for next weekend’s 70th Anniversary Grand Prix.
However, Hamilton headed out to track at the start of FP1, where he finished in P2 behind Max Verstappen, with it already fitted.
Given that drivers are only allowed three per season, it seemed rather early for him to be taking his second.
However, according to the team, the change was made just as a precaution following some concern found in data after the last Grand Prix.

“It’s a precautionary change one race earlier than planned due to some data anomalies after Hungary,” a Mercedes spokesperson told Autosport.com.
“It’s an updated spec of MGU-K for reliability reasons, which will be on all cars from next weekend.”
With their pace so strong, reliability is the area that Mercedes is most concerned about and the one receiving the most attention going forward.
However, after some worries about both cars making it to the finish at the season opener, there have been no major issues since.
With this race weekend set to be a warm one though, such concerns may return, as James Allison recently stated worries about how the car will run in hot weather.
“I’d note that we’ve had two quite cool tracks,” he told Autosport.
“So far it was warmish in the first race of the year, but that was also the race where we were least convincing.
“So we would like to find out just how swift we can be when the track is roasting hot, and whether or not we can still show the sort of tyre management and pace under those conditions that we’ve been lucky enough to show in the opening races of the year.
“Every car on the grid has a sword of Damocles hanging over it pretty much every lap, because they are all experimental vehicles with any number of ways that they can catch you out, or actually, you disappoint yourself for not having seen it coming.”
Valtteri Bottas and the Williams and Racing Point drivers will all receive the new spec next weekend as originally planned.

Nico Hulkenberg bagged a P9 on his F1 comeback but it came with a bit of pain as the German’s first run in a F1 car in seven months left him with a sore butt.
With Sergio Perez sidelined for the British GP after a positive test, Racing Point were on the hunt for a driver to replace the Mexican.
They turned to former driver Hulkenberg, who raced for the team from 2011 to 2016.
After jumping through a few hurdles, including requiring a negative Covid-19 test, he was confirmed just minutes before FP1 for the British Grand Prix got underway at Silverstone on Friday morning.
The German was one of the first drivers out on track, putting in his first lap in a Formula 1 car is some seven months.

Max Verstappen was having headrest problems, telling the team that he didn’t “like” the blocks on the side as he “cannot move his head”. He returned to the pits to have that sorted out.
Kimi Raikkonen posted the first time of the session, a 1:32.661, he also had the first off as he picked up a bit too much wheel spin at the exit of Luffield and spun off into the gravel.
Moments later his team-mate Antonio Giovinazzi fluffed it at Becketts, destroyed his rear tyres and the floor of his C38. Not a great start to the weekend for Alfa Romeo.
Giovinazzi’s off brought out the red flags as the marshals were called in to clear the debris from the gravel and the bits of rubber and carbon fibre his car spewed.

Alfa Romeo’s troubles weren’t quite as bad as those down at Ferrari, at least for Sebastian Vettel.
He completed all of two laps before returning to the pits.
“We have detected something wrong with the intercooler system on Seb’s car so we have to strip the car down and check, to be ready for FP2,” the team tweeted.
With the pit lane again open for action, Mercedes ventured out with Valtteri Bottas going quickest ahead of Lance Stroll, Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.
The six-time British GP winner went quickest on his next hot lap on the soft tyres, clocking a 1:28.3. Verstappen, running the hard tyres, improved to third.
Hamilton’s soft tyres were not holding up well on the 44’C track, with the Brit telling his team that the “tyre is terrible” after just eight laps.
The best complaint, though, came from Hulkenberg. He informed Racing Point that his “right ass cheek is getting a bit numb”. The German worked his way up to ninth place after an hour, just 0.7s down on team-mate Stroll.

Back out on track for a second run, Hamilton lowered his benchmark time to a 1:27.8 only to be pipped by Verstappen moments later.
The Red Bull driver took almost half a second off Hamilton’s best, purple in the first and second sectors as he ran the soft Pirelli tyres.
Stroll finished third, 0.582s down on Verstappen’s best, with Alex Albon fourth ahead of Charles Leclerc and Bottas.
As for Hulkenberg, he was P9, 0.6s slower than Stroll.

Bracing for a difficult season, if not a difficult two years, Charles Leclerc feels it is important that Ferrari is honest about its ongoing struggles.
Following pre-season testing, Ferrari conceded that it was off the pace and could have a tough time at the start of this year’s championship.
It, however, has been worse than they expected.
Three races into this season and the team is down in fifth place in the Constructors’ Championship with only 27 points on the board compared to Mercedes’ 121.
Such has been Ferrari’s troubles that both Sebastian Vettel and Leclerc were lapped by Lewis Hamilton last time out at the Styrian Grand Prix.
And with Formula 1 set to continue racing this year’s cars in next year’s championship, Ferrari president John Elkann has come out saying Ferrari won’t be competitive until 2022 when the new rules come into effect.
“The reality is that our car is not competitive,” Elkann admitted to Gazzetta Dello Sport.
“You saw it on the track and you will see it again. Today we are laying the foundations for being competitive and returning to winning when the rules change in 2022. I am convinced of this.”
It was not the news that the tifosi or even the Ferrari drivers wanted to hear.

However, Leclerc says it is important the Scuderia is honest about where it stands.
“The most important thing in tough times like this is to be honest,” Leclerc said via F1i.com when asked about Elkann’s comment.
“That was exactly the message.
“We know how hard everyone is working in the paddock and also the other teams, so once we are a bit down on performance, to recover this performance takes time.
“Everyone is working, nobody is on holidays in the paddock. So it’s going to take time and we need to be honest.”
And Ferrari can honestly expect a difficult two weeks ahead at the Silverstone circuit.
One of the last of Formula 1’s true power hungry circuits, the Scuderia and its customers are predicting a struggle this weekend.
The Ferrari engine is down on power compared to last year, its horsepower slashed by the FIA’s Technical Directives banning fuel burning.
Leclerc is still trying to remain optimistic ahead of back-to-back races at Silverstone.
“This year on paper it doesn’t look like a strong track for us,” he added, “But I want to be optimistic and I like to be optimistic.
“I’ll give it all and we’ll see where we’ll be at.
“But realistically, I think it’s going to be difficult.”

Ferrari’s British Grand Prix weekend has not got off to the best of starts, with Sebastian Vettel ruled out of the first practice session.
The departing Scuderia driver was able to head out on track on a very sunny and warm Friday morning at Silverstone, but his SF1000 was soon back up on the stands in the garage without a time being set.
Ferrari had discovered a problem with the intercooler system, so the car needed to be stripped down and reassessed ahead of the second practice session on Friday afternoon.

Vettel’s future in Formula 1 is still one of the hottest topics in and outside the paddock, but he has called for some patience as we await official confirmation of his next step.
Asked if there is any update on his future, Vettel said: “I have no answer. I think it’s probably realistic to be patient  and wait a little bit. That could be a couple of weeks, that could be longer than that.
“Time will tell. Nothing has changed to what I mentioned in the last three weeks.
“I’m not in a rush, I want to make sure that I make the right decision for myself and then take it from there. I think I’ve made it quite clear in the last events that given the right package etc then I have a lot more to give.
“I feel physically driving and so on that I’m no worse than I have been in the years that I’ve been in Formula 1 before. I feel very good and there’s a lot to give, so it depends what the options are.
“Looking to the future there’s the big rule change in 2022 which might be exciting or might not be, I think we don’t know sitting here now. I think you always hope for the better & as a fan of the sport I hope so too, but whether I will be there or not I don’t know.”

Nico Hulkenberg’s shock return to Formula 1 has been confirmed, replacing Sergio Perez at Racing Point for the British Grand Prix weekend.
Hulkenberg has been drafted in by one of his former teams after Perez became the first Formula 1 driver on the grid to test positive for COVID-19. His first test returned inconclusive and his second ensured that he will have to spend the next 10 days in self-isolation.
Racing Point said the plan was still to run two cars at the Silverstone circuit, sparking a sudden wave of rumours as to who would possibly replace the Mexican.
The team usually have Mercedes reserves Esteban Gutierrez and Stoffel Vandoorne to call upon, but Gutierrez’s lengthy spell on the sidelines was a turn-off while Vandoorne had not initially travelled to Silverstone because of his Formula E commitments.
That paved the way for Hulkenberg, who left the grid at the end of the 2019 campaign following a spell at Renault, to return to action at very short notice.
The German driver, who holds the unwanted record of the most Formula 1 races without a podium (179), was spotted arriving at Silverstone on Friday morning.
The worst kept secret in Formula 1 was out of the bag.

After he tested negative for COVID-19, Hulkenberg was officially announced as Perez’s replacement.
It was close call, though, to get him confirmed ahead of FP1. His name replaced Perez’s on the official timesheet with just seven  minutes left until the first practice session.

“I was on my way to the Nürburgring for another racing project when the call from Otmar came,” Hulkenberg said.
“That was less than 24 hours ago, so it feels a bit surreal for me right now, but I like a good challenge and this is certainly one.
“It’s obviously a difficult situation for Racing Point and Checo. He’s a buddy of mine, an old team-mate and I wish him a speedy recovery. I’ll step in and try do the best I can for the team!”
Team boss Otmar Szafnauer added: “Having to find a replacement for Sergio at short notice is no easy task, but in Nico we’ve got a fantastic supersub who the team knows very well. He’s certainly being thrown in at the deep end, but he’s a fast learner and I’m sure he will get up to speed quickly.”

Then I came back to Europe, same way, with all the protocols in place.“I just got it, I don’t know from where. I have no symptoms at all.

Sergio Perez says he followed all the protocols that F1 has in place when he returned to Mexico to see his mother after she had a “big accident”.
Perez will miss this weekend’s British Grand Prix and perhaps also next weekend’s 70th Anniversary GP at the same track having tested positive for the coronavirus.
In the week’s break between the Hungarian and British GPs, he revealed he returned to Mexico to visit his mother who had been in an accident.
Despite following all the protocols and instructions, he still tested positive upon his arrival in the United Kingdom.
As such he has to sit out this weekend’s grand prix, calling it one of the “saddest” days of his career.
“Hi everybody, as you know I tested positive for Covid-19,” he said in a video posted on his social channels.
“I’m extremely sad, it’s definitely one of the saddest moments of my career, the preparation we put in to this weekend to be 100 per cent ready for it, I knew I had a great car, the team had done a fantastic job.
“I’m really sad this happened but it shows how vulnerable we are all to this virus.
“I followed all of the instructions from the FIA and my team, after Hungary, to take a private plane to Mexico to see my mum for two days as she had a big accident.
“As soon as she left hospital I could see her, then I came back to Europe the same way, with all the protocols in place.
“I got it, I don’t know from where, I have no symptoms at all, it shows how vulnerable we all are.
“I want to thank my fellow drivers for all the support they have given me, my team, the authorities, the fans.
“It is a tough moment for me at the moment but I’m sure I will come back stronger from this.
“Stay safe, look after yourself, and your families, and I hope to see you soon at the race track.”

This is not the first time that Perez has missed a grand prix Sunday.
Back in 2011 he suffered a massive crash during qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix and was declared unfit to race on the Sunday.
He also had a non-start at the 2014 Malaysian GP when a gearbox issue meant he couldn’t take the start.
Perez is expected to be replaced by Nico Hulkenberg for the British Grand Prix with the former F1 driver in the paddock and reportedly just awaiting the result of his own Covid-19 test.

It gave me a renewed bit of energy to perhaps go longer,” added the Briton, who can take a record seventh home win at Silverstone this weekend.Hamilton, who is leading team mate Valtteri Bottas by five points in the championship after winning two of three races this season, has 86 career victories.The champion said he wanted to be able to continue performing at his current level.“There is a point at which physicality and the mental side tail off, and I don’t know when that’s going to be, but I don’t see that happening in the short term, in the next two or three years,” he said.“Also we’re in a period of time where there’s not another driver from my background coming up at the moment, and I’m conscious of that as well,” added the sport’s sole Black driver, who has been outspoken on racial justice and equality.“So my goal is to continue to deliver for as long as I can, I do see myself going for at least another three years.”The post Hamilton: I see myself going for at least another three years appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/31/hamilton-i-see-myself-going-for-another-three-years/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Russell: It looks better on me, the better Lando and Alex are doing<img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> -

The retest yielded a positive result, leaving Perez to quarantine and sit out both Silverstone races.It has emerged that Nico Hulkenberg is Racing Point’s favourite to sit in for Perez, ahead of reserve drivers Esteban Gutierrez and Stoffel Vandoorne.Hulkenberg spent five years with Force India, as they were then known, in 2012 and between 2014 and 2016. The Hulk had previously been driving with Renault, his last F1 start the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but lost his seat in 2020 having been ousted by the returning Esteban Ocon.Although Racing Point don’t have a dedicated reserve driver, they do share Mercedes’ reserve squad in the shape of Esteban Gutierrez and Stoffel Vandoorne. Vandoorne will not be present at Silverstone this weekend due to commitments with Formula E while Gutierrez hasn’t made a Grand Prix start since 2016.Should Hulkenberg be called back into action, he too will have to undergo testing for coronavirus and finalise a deal with Racing Point for his services.FIA Race Director Michael Masi has said that official confirmation of the replacement is not expected until Friday. Racing Point will have to make an approach to the FIA who would then approve the change.This story will be updated when further details are confirmed.  The post Hulkenberg favourite to replace Perez at Silverstone appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/30/hulkenberg-favourite-to-replace-perez-at-silverstone/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">2020 British Grand Prix: F1 Drivers Chat Ahead of Race Weekend<img src="youtube.png" style="padding: 8px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="14px" height="14px"> - <span class="source">FORMULA 1</span><br /><span class="time">03:02 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>The teams and drivers arrived for media duties in sunny Silverstone, ahead of the British Grand Prix.

It is understood he has not been present at Silverstone, but team-personnel close to Perez have also self-isolated as a precaution.Racing Point have said that Checo is “physically well and in good spirits” with the team still intending to field two cars in Sunday’s race.Racing Point share Mercedes reserve drivers Stoffel Vandoorne and Esteban Gutierrez.Vandoorne is believed to be preparing for Formula E’s upcoming bumper package in Berlin so the onus is likely to fall on Gutierrez. Talk in the paddock has also suggested former Force India driver Nico Hulkenberg is also in contention for a ride in the RP20 this weekend.Perez will miss both races at Silverstone due to the British Government now enforcing a ten-day quarantine for those exhibiting coronavirus symptoms.This article will be updated once more details have been confirmed.The post Perez tests positive for Covid-19, will miss both Silverstone races appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/30/perez-tests-positive-for-covid-19-will-miss-british-gp/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">F1: Perez: FIA releases statement<img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> - <span class="source">Pitpass</span><br /><span class="time">02:35 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>The FIA has released an official statement after Sergio Point tested positive for the coronavirus this evening.</p><a href="http://www.pitpass.com/67472/Perez-FIA-releases-statement" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">F1: Perez to miss British Grand Prix<img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> - <span class="source">Pitpass</span><br /><span class="time">02:27 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Racing Point has confirmed that Sergio Perez will miss this weekend's British Grand Prix after testing positive for the coronavirus.</p><a href="http://www.pitpass.com/67471/Perez-to-miss-British-Grand-Prix" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Perez tests positive for COVID-19, will miss British GP<img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> - <span class="source">Motorsport.com</span><br /><span class="time">02:26 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Racing Point driver Perez was not present at Silverstone on Thursday after his latest COVID-19 test result proved inconclusive, meaning he required a re-test.In a statement issued by the FIA on Thursday evening, it was announced that Perez’s second test result had come back positive.“Following today’s announcement that Sergio Perez of the BWT Racing Point Formula 1 ...Keep reading</p><a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/sergio-perez-confirmed-covid-19-positive/4846474/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RSS-F1&utm_term=News&utm_content=www" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Red Bull to test wealth of upgrades in Friday practice<img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> - <span class="source">GRAND PRIX 247</span><br /><span class="time">02:25 PM</span></button><div class="content"><p>Red Bull are looking to trial a wealth of upgrades in Friday Practice for the British Grand Prix this weekend.The team has had a rocky start to 2020 with team principal Christian Horner admitting the RB16 has some “anomalies“.Red Bull have seemingly found themselves to be Mercedes’ nearest rivals when it comes to race pace, but have still failed to match the reigning champions’ pace.Their home race at the Austrian Grand Prix brought a double retirement for the Red Bull, losing Max Verstappen early and Albon dropping out late in the action.Verstappen, Red Bull’s protagonist in the drivers’ championship,  sits 30 points off leader Hamilton. It gets worse in the constructor’s standings as Red Bull may sit in second place, but lay 66 points adrift of Mercedes after three races.Both Albon and Verstappen have complained of balance issues with the RB16. In an attempt to try and stabilise things and bring the gap to Mercedes down, Red Bull are bringing “a lot of new parts to the car” this weekend.“They are different parts, to see what works, what doesn’t, and where we can still improve,” said Verstappen.“I mean this is of course not from one week to the other that it is going to be solved. We need a bit more time for that.“But, yeah, we’re working on it, and we’ll just find out by trying it on track as well, to know if we’re heading into the right direction.”In qualifying for last years British GP, Verstappen was able to remain within two-tenths of the Mercedes duo. With the W11 expected to be perfectly suited to Silverstone’s high-speed nature, the Dutchman is looking to be within half a second of the likely pole-sitters. However, he hasn’t ruled out the gap being as big as a second.Whether the upgrades will bring Mercedes some competition or not is yet to be seen, but Red Bull haven’t given up the chase just yet. The post Red Bull to test wealth of upgrades in Friday practice appeared first on GRAND PRIX 247.</p><a href="https://www.grandprix247.com/2020/07/30/red-bull-to-test-wealth-of-upgrades-in-friday-practice/" target="_blank">Read More</a><br /><br /></div><button class="collapsible">Perez ruled out of British GP after testing positive for Covid-19 <img src="paperclip.png" style="padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px;" "width="12px" height="12px"> -
